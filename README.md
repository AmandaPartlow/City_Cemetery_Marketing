### WIP: Nashville Software School project using Nashville City Cemetery data to create a marketing campaign  

The purpose of this assignment was to use data provided by [The Nashville City Cemetery](http://www.thenashvillecitycemetery.org/) to create a marketing campaign in order to generate traffic and revenue at the Nashville City Cemetery. The focus of the project was the utilization of pivot tables. I went down many different avenues of data exploration, as depicted in the various worksheets. I landed on the interesting changing of spellings of words over time and created a billboard ad campaign. This is just a mockup. I will be creating a better-looking final version including multiple word versions of the billboard for use throughout the city.
