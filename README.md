**WIP: Nashville Software School project using Nashville City Cemetery data to create a marketing campaign**  

The purpose of this assignment was to create a marketing campaign to generate traffic at the Nashville City Cemetery. I went down many different avenues of data exploration, as depicted in the various worksheets. I landed on the changing of spellings of words over time and created a billboard campaign. This is just a mockup. I will be creating a better-looking final version including multiple word versions of the billboard for use throughout the city.
